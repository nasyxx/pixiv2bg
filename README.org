* Pixiv to Backgrounds

Thanks to [[https://github.com/LoveLiveSunshine/pixiv.moe]], this project uses its API to crawl popularity sorted pictures to your desktop backgrounds.

** How to use?

Simply clone this project to your computer and then ~make~

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/nasyxx/pixiv2bg.git ~/pixiv2bg && cd ~/pixiv2bg && make
#+END_SRC



You can change some configs in ~config.py~ easily or just directly modify the code. I think it is very easy that you can understan the code.
